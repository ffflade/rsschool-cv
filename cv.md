### About me
Firstly, I'am a person, who is trying to achive my best and reach all my potential. Sometimes i work hard, sometimes i don't. And my the strongest skill is Paretto's Law. I know when i can make 20% effort and get 80% result.

Secondly, my comunicatianal skills - are my treasure. I was studying managing people for 2.5 years in Belarussian State University, so i have practicied a lot in debating, solving problems and> of course, communicating.
